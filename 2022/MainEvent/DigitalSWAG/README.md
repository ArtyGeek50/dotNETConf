# Digital SWAG for .NET Conf 2022

Our designer team has put together some great wallpapers to celebrate .NET Conf and the release of .NET 7.  In this folder, you can find wallpapers for your phone, desktop, watch, even Microsoft Teams.

We ALSO have a new "digital pet" .NET Bot available for you to add to Visual Studio Code and play with as you're working with .NET 7.  Check out the digital pet extension and enable 'Mod' the .NET Bot at: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonybaloney.vscode-pets
